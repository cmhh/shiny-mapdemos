## Shiny Map Demos

Just a few very basic shiny applications to demonstrate working with leaflet
maps and highchart maps:

* mapdemo01 - basic `sidebarLayout` with leaflet map
* mapdemo02 - same as mapdemo01, but with some CSS tweaks to make the map fill the remainder of the page vertically
* mapdemo03 - similar to mapdemo01 and 02, but regions are selected by clicking, rather than selecting from a `selectInput`
* mapdemo04 - similar to mapdemo01, but using an HTML template rather than a `shinyUI`
* mapdemo04 - basic `sidebarLayout` with highchart map.
